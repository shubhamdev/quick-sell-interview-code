### Feature:

- The counter can be initialised with a certain value. If no value is present at initialisation then the counter will start at 1.
- The counter can be initialised with a max value. If no max value is present, then assume that the max value will be 1000. If a max value is present then the counter can be incremented to only that max value.
- The user can also type a value into the counter
- The user can decrement or increment the value with `-` and `+` buttons
